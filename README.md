# Music Theory App

This is a really simple app that I created in order to practice a little of what I've learned in Java. I've always had some difficulties in figuring out how to actually practice what I have learned. One day I was playing the guitar and I thought about making a small app that would show me the musical notes on the staff, and I would have to guess which note was which.

The app is quite simple:
  1. You have an image of the staff.
  2. You press the "New Session" button.
  3. A random note is shown on top of the staff
  4. You select on the list the note's name that you think correponds to the note shown
  5. Press the "Submit" button
  6. Repeat 10x
  7. If you need a hint, click the "Hint" button and a new window is shown, with a picture of the staff with all of the notes and it's names.
  8. After you're done, your score is shown, and you can start again.
  
Future fixes and implementations:
  1. Be able to expand the number of rounds in each session, and have the labels and progress bar update accordingly
  2. Instead of showing the results inside a text area, show them in big labels that fade in and out
  3. Add Internationalization
  4. ...

I know this is really really really basic stuff, but it's a start. I'm having all sorts of questions about the software architecture, so if you have an opinion, please let me know!
