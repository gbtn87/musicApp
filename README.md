# Music Theory App

This is a really simple app that I created in order to practice a little of what I've learned in Java. I've always had some difficulties in figuring ut how to actually practice what I have learned. One day I was playing the guitar and I thought about making a small app that would show me the musical notes on the staff, and I would have to guess which note was it.

The app is quite simple:
  1. You have and image of the staff.
  2. You press the "New Session" button.
  3. A random note is shown on top of the staff
  4. You select on the list the note's name that you think correponds to the note shown
  5. Press the "Submit" button
  6. Repeat 10x
  7. If you need a hint, click the "Hint" button and a new window is shown, with a picture of the staff with all of the notes and it's names.
  8. After you're done, your score is shown, and you can start again.
